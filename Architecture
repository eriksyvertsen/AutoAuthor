<<<Initial Prompt>>>
You are a full-stack developer.

I would like to use ChatGPT to help me write a book.  ChatGPT is good at outlining, but it cannot write the whole book from one prompt.  When I ask it to write it chapter by chapter in separate prompts, it starts repeating itself in later chapters since it does not hold onto the context of what has come before.  

Outline the architecture for a simple MVP that will perform the following:
1. Ingest chapter outlines from a text field.
2. Break the chapters into prompts with instructions to write the chapter (length, etc.). The instructions should be editable.  OK if global for the MVP.
3. Generate the text for the first chapter.
4. Summarize that chapter
5. Add the summary from the first chapter to the prompt for the next chapter. 
6. Generate the text for the next chapter.
7. Summarize the net chapter, add that to the preceding summary, and generate a new summary. 
8. Add the updated summary to the prompt for the next chapter.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until the book is complete. 

This should be very simple. I will run it on Replit.  Assume I use the OpenAI API to access chat GPT. 

<<<Response>>>
our project idea for a book writing assistant using ChatGPT is fascinating and certainly achievable. The architecture for such an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) can be outlined as follows:

Architecture Overview
Frontend:

A web interface where you can input and edit chapter outlines.
A text field to input and edit prompt instructions (like length).
Display area for the generated chapter text and summaries.
Navigation for moving between chapters and overseeing the book's progress.
Backend:

A server (Node.js/Express can be a good choice for simplicity and compatibility with Replit).
Integration with OpenAI's GPT API for text generation and summarization.
Logic to manage the flow of data between the frontend, the OpenAI API, and the storage system.
Storage:

A database or file storage system to persist chapter outlines, generated texts, and summaries.
Detailed Workflow
Ingest Chapter Outlines:

User inputs chapter outlines via the frontend.
Outlines are stored in the backend storage system.
Prompt Management:

User sets global instructions for chapter generation (like length) via the frontend.
These settings are stored and retrieved as needed.
Generate First Chapter:

Backend sends the first chapter outline and user instructions to the OpenAI API.
Receives generated text and sends it to the frontend for display.
Stores the generated text in the storage system.
Summarize First Chapter:

Backend sends the generated text to the OpenAI API for summarization.
Receives the summary, displays it on the frontend, and stores it.
Iterative Chapter Generation:

For each subsequent chapter:
Combine the previous summary (or summaries) with the new chapter outline.
Send this combined prompt to the OpenAI API to generate the chapter text.
Summarize the newly generated text.
Update the cumulative summary with this new summary.
Store all generated texts and summaries.
Repeat Steps:

Continue the process until all chapters are completed.
Review and Editing:

Provide functionality for the user to review, edit, and regenerate any chapter as necessary.
Technical Considerations
API Rate Limits and Costs: Be aware of the OpenAI API's rate limits and potential costs associated with the number of requests.
Data Persistence: Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of texts and summaries, especially as the book grows in length.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that allows easy navigation and editing.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling, especially for API interactions.
Security: Secure the interface to protect the user's work.
Final Notes
This architecture provides a basic framework. Depending on your needs and feedback from initial users, you can iterate and add features like chapter reordering, more granular control over prompts, or advanced text editing tools. Running on Replit is a practical choice for an MVP, as it simplifies deployment and hosting.
